The Customer agrees to pay to or reimburse Siemens for any taxes, customs, duties or other public charges levied on Siemens in relation to the Works. All payments shall be made to Siemens' bank account without deduction (e.g. deduction of withholding tax) within 30 days after issuance of the invoice.

3.3	All payment obligations of the Customer towards Siemens under this Contract, the Customer shall provide Siemens with an irrevocable and unconditional letter of credit (referred to as "L/C") in favor of Siemens, in the amount of all of the Customer's payment obligations, allowing partial and trans-shipments as well as partial drawings, to be opened at the date of Contract signature at the order of the Customer by a first-class international bank acceptable to Siemens.

The L/C shall be payable at sight in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and be available at the counters of the advising or confirming bank respectively against presentation of the commercial invoices or advance payment invoices issued by Siemens.

The L/C shall be valid for the entire stated delivery period plus 3 additional months. The L/C shall be amended as required to cover any price adjustments. All expenses, commissions and charges arising in connection with the L/C shall be borne by the Customer. The Customer shall indemnify Siemens for any such expenses, commissions and charges deducted by a bank.

If a payment request of Siemens under the L/C is rejected or payment is not received by Siemens within 30 days after the payment request, Siemens may claim payment from the Customer.

The Customer shall ensure that (i) the L/C remains valid and enforceable until all payment obligations towards Siemens have been fulfilled, and (ii) the amount available for drawing under the L/C is at no time less than the amount of all payment obligations of the Customer towards Siemens under this Contract.

12.4	Any limitations of liability set forth in this Contract shall also apply for the benefit of Siemens' subcontractors, employees, agents or any other person acting for Siemens.
